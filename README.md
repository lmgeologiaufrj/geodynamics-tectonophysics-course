# Geodynamics and Tectonophysics Course

Welcome to the **Geodynamics and Tectonophysics Course**!

This repository contains a structured 6-month learning program for geologists and Earth science professionals interested in:

- Theoretical and computational geodynamics
- Tectonophysics and lithospheric mechanics
- Practical implementation of numerical models using Python

## 📚 Course Structure

The course is divided into four main modules:

1. **Fundamentals**  
   Vector calculus, stress-strain tensors, heat conduction, rheology

2. **Tectonophysics**  
   Lithospheric strength, brittle-ductile transition, flexure, isostasy

3. **Computational Modeling**  
   Finite element modeling (FEniCS), particle-based models (Underworld), thermal convection

4. **Case Studies & Final Project**  
   Realistic tectonic simulations: rifting, subduction, lithosphere dynamics

Each week includes:
- Theoretical background linked to textbooks (Turcotte & Schubert, Ranalli, Gerya, Morra, Watts, Fossen, Schey)
- Jupyter notebooks for numerical modeling
- Hands-on coding and visualization exercises

## 🚀 Getting Started

Create your Python environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geodynamics
```

Or install via pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
